Given the known issue at hand when creating these simulations models and running them, there is a better way to address this. To solve this problem, we can create a simpler model or use a modified existing model to be able to function with AR capabilities to simulate such events. Using an AR capable device such as a Smartphone or tablet, we can simply open the application for the compatible AR tabletop simulator and by using the deviceâ€™s camera, visualize these events. Within the application, it will have ways to toggle or interact with the model as if you would physically in real life and evoke certain events. Where this would have the same effect if not more in being able to demonstrate and educate others as you would in a physical interaction.
