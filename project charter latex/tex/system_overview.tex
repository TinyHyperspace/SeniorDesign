In this project, we propose a high-level system that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to visualize the environmental impact of human behavior on water systems. The goal is to raise awareness about how everyday actions, such as littering, can influence water flow and ultimately affect the quality of the water we consume. The system will simulate water runoff in various environments and demonstrate how pollutants travel through drainage systems into natural water bodies. The AR experience will be presented on a physical 1.5 x 1.5 meter demonstration table, enabling users to interact with a dynamic, visual representation of water flow and pollution spread.
