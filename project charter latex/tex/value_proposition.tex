With such capabilities of making these AR simulated events, not only making it easier to be accessible in any setting but also more cost effective in a sense. Where we strongly believe in having this, we will aim to empower communities with an immersive, educational AR experience that brings environmental awareness to life. By turning a simple tabletop into a 3D learning tool, our project solution helps not only businesses but also families understand how their everyday actions affect local water systems as well as extreme situations such as flooding.
